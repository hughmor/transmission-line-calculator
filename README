# transmission-line-calculator

This project will work its way through all the designs in Brian Wadell's 1991 reference textbook "Transmission Line Design Handbook" and implement functions to calculate characteristic impedance and loss for all the geometries in the book.
Currently, I've only written a function for the "Coplanar Strip" waveguide design because I couldn't find any other calculator tool online or in popular software like KiCAD which had a calculator for this design.
